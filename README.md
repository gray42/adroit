# ADROIT

ADROIT is a microframework for PHP implementing the Action-Domain-Responder (ADR) pattern.

The ADR pattern was proposed by Paul M. Jones as a refinement of Model-View-Controller (MVC) and is better suited for web applications. If you need more information about ADR refer to <http://pmjones.io/adr/>.
